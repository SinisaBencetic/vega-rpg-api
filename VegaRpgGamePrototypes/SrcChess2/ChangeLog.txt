WPF chess program from :

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36112/Chess-Program-in-C

Itention is to break it into client server chess program.
Client shall be passive and thin and will consume REST-full web (ASP.NET WEBAPI) service for 
AI logic.
Hence I need to move all smart AI non-visual dependant stuff to web service side.
